XDCCmon for X-Chat
==================

XDCCmon is a small perl script for [X-Chat](http://xchat.org) that monitors XDCC file offerings on all open channels. It's possible to search the collection and start leeching by entering short commands.

This script was formerly published under reactor.de/xdccmon/ in the year 2003. AFAIK, it needs some patching for X-Chat 2, but apparently it got some friends over the years, so I thought I'll just put it up here.

There was a version 0.6 back then, never published, introducing some filter functionality IIRC. But it seems lost on some old disk drive or tape...

Pull requests welcome.
